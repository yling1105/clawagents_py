# 🦀 PinchBench

**Real-world benchmarks for AI coding agents**

> **Note:** This repository contains the benchmark skill/tasks. It is NOT the source of official leaderboard results. To add models to the official results, modify [pinchbench/scripts/default-models.yml](https://github.com/pinchbench/scripts/blob/main/default-models.yml).

PinchBench measures how well LLM models perform as the brain of an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agent. Instead of synthetic tests, we throw real tasks at agents: scheduling meetings, writing code, triaging email, researching topics, and managing files.

Results are collected on a public leaderboard at **[pinchbench.com](https://pinchbench.com)**.

## Why PinchBench?

Most LLM benchmarks test isolated capabilities. PinchBench tests what actually matters for coding agents:

- **Tool usage** — Can the model call the right tools with the right parameters?
- **Multi-step reasoning** — Can it chain together actions to complete complex tasks?
- **Real-world messiness** — Can it handle ambiguous instructions and incomplete information?
- **Practical outcomes** — Did it actually create the file, send the email, or schedule the meeting?

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the skill
git clone https://github.com/pinchbench/skill.git
cd skill

# Run benchmarks with your model of choice
./scripts/run.sh --model openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4

# Or run specific tasks
./scripts/run.sh --model openrouter/openai/gpt-4o --suite task_01_calendar,task_02_stock
```

> **Note:** Model IDs must include their provider prefix (e.g. `openrouter/`, `anthropic/`). [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) is the default provider used for routing.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- A running OpenClaw instance

## What Gets Tested

PinchBench includes 23 tasks across real-world categories:

| Category         | Tasks                                   | What's tested                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Productivity** | Calendar, daily summaries               | Event creation, time parsing, scheduling |
| **Research**     | Stock prices, conferences, markets      | Web search, data extraction, synthesis   |
| **Writing**      | Blog posts, emails, humanization        | Content generation, tone, formatting     |
| **Coding**       | Weather scripts, file structures        | Code generation, file operations         |
| **Analysis**     | Spreadsheets, PDFs, documents           | Data processing, summarization           |
| **Email**        | Triage, search                          | Inbox management, filtering              |
| **Memory**       | Context retrieval, knowledge management | Long-term memory, recall                 |
| **Skills**       | ClawHub, skill discovery                | OpenClaw ecosystem integration           |

Each task is graded automatically, by an LLM judge, or both — ensuring both objective and nuanced evaluation.

## Submitting Results

To get your results on the leaderboard:

```bash
# Register for an API token (one-time)
./scripts/run.sh --register

# Run benchmark — results auto-upload with your token
./scripts/run.sh --model openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
```

Skip uploading with `--no-upload` if you just want local results.

### Official Results

To submit an official run (marked on the leaderboard):

```bash
# Using environment variable
export PINCHBENCH_OFFICIAL_KEY=your_official_key
./scripts/run.sh --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4

# Using command line flag
./scripts/run.sh --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 --official-key your_official_key
```

## Contributing Tasks

We welcome new tasks! Check out [`tasks/TASK_TEMPLATE.md`](tasks/TASK_TEMPLATE.md) for the format. Good tasks are:

- **Real-world** — Something an actual user would ask an agent to do
- **Measurable** — Clear success criteria that can be graded
- **Reproducible** — Same task should produce consistent grading
- **Challenging** — Tests agent capabilities, not just LLM knowledge
